mixamo-cli 1.0.0
Batch convert a directory containing fbx mixamo animations to gltf

USAGE:
    mixamo-cli ./path/to/my/dir

OPTIONS:
    -s, --scale         Divide the export scale by an integer factor. Default is 100, which will export the model at
                        1/100 of its size.
    -i, --includeMain   Include the main mesh animations (usually T-Pose and empty anim). Default is false.
    -o, --output        Define the output path of the gltf. If omitted, the output will be generated in the current
                        directory and its name will be based on the input path.

dir must be a directory containing a bunch of fbx (animations) files and one mixamo character (as a fbx file).
dir will not be recursively traversed, just one level deep.
