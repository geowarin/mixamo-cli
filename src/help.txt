mixamo-cli 1.0.0
Batch convert a directory containing fbx mixamo animations to gltf

USAGE:
    mixamo-cli ./path/to/my/dir

OPTIONS:
    -s, --scale         Divide the export scale by an integer factor. Default is 100, which will export the model at
                        1/100 of its size.
    -i, --includeMain   Include the main mesh animations (usually T-Pose and empty anim). Default is false.

dir must be a directory containing a bunch of fbx (animations) files and one mixamo character (as a fbx file).
dir will not be recursively traversed, just one level deep.
